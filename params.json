Should we give the input a switch to make the \"structure\" porous instead of solid or use separate examples for porous structures\r\n2. What are the top four or five cases where we should try to recreate lab flumes exactly (probably shouldn't try really long flumes yet)?\r\n3. What are the top three cases where lab flumes may not exist but the computational results are interesting enough to be worth trying? (e.g. the corps castle for PR, high-res breaking infragravity waves, \r\nmach stem problem for oblique waves overtopping levee)\r\n\r\n#Wave functions\r\n\r\n* Boundary and Initial Conditions\r\n* * 1D Monochromatic waves based on linear wave theory (general finite depth solution)\r\n* * 1D Nearly monochromatic wave groups based on linear wave theory\r\n* Initial Conditions Only\r\n* * JONSWAP spectrum\r\n* * Solitary wave (does not appear to be implemented correctly)\r\n\r\n1. How important are directional waves in \"wide\" tanks as opposed to using a narrow tank and changing the angle of the structure? (i.e. do we need to push for completion of the 2D wave functions or do I need to prioritize other classes of waves)\r\n2. The correct implementation of KDV solution for solitons is critical, yes?\r\n3. Is there a very detailed presentation of the stokes and cnoidal quasi-analytical solutions I can use for implementing them?\r\n\r\n#Simulations\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0oeSU_XtUirbE9GcTRBOUtrUjA/preview\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","name":"Proteus-mprans","tagline":"Module for solving 3D, non-hydrostatic, turbulent, incompressible air/water flow (multi-phase RANS)","google":""}
